# Ceaser-Cipher
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption methods, named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.
Here's a sample GitHub repository description for the Caesar Cipher project:

## Features

- **Encode**: Encrypts a given message by shifting letters to the right.
- **Decode**: Decrypts an encoded message by reversing the shift.
- **Custom Shift**: Allows users to specify the shift value for encryption or decryption.
- **Looping**: The program can handle large shift values by wrapping around the alphabet.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the Python script.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to encode or decode a message with a specified shift value.
